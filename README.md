rtsp
====

`rtsp` is a toy program I wrote that can consume RTSP stream. In order to do that, I implemented the following:

- RTSP protocol support
- SDP protocol support
- RTP/RTCP protocol support
- RTSP over TCP interleaved support

Although a toy, you can use it as the foundation of the RTSP client in your own program.
